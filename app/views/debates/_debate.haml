This website has voluntarily been taken down in protest against this law, which will be used to disconnect New Zealanders from the internet based on accusations of copyright infringement, without a trial and without evidence held up to court scrutiny. May we be very clear: we do not support or condone copyright infringement or illegal downloads. But this blatant disregard towards the basic human right to a fair trial is completely unjust and unworkable and it has the potential to punish New Zealand businesses and individuals where in fact no laws have been broken. Similar laws have been rejected in the EU as being against \"a fair balance between various fundamental rights\", rejected in the UK due to \"impracticalities\", and rejected in Germany as being 'Unfit for Germany, Unfit For Europe'. We don't care who voted for the law in the first place. We just want it stopped. We call on the Minister responsible, National's Simon Power, to do the right thing and repeal Section 92A immediately.
