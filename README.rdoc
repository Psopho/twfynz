== Install steps

If the message above didn't put you off here are some install steps.

First make sure you have git installed on your machine <http://git.or.cz/>.
Also be sure to have Ruby installed <http://www.ruby-lang.org/>. Then:

 git clone git://github.com/robmckinnon/twfynz.git

 cd twfynz/
 git submodule init
 git submodule update   # pulls in rails, rspec and haml

 cd config/
 cp database.yml.example database.yml
 vi database.yml        # edit database.yml as required
 sudo mysql create twfynz_test
 sudo mysql create twfynz_development
 sudo mysql create twfynz_production

 cd ..
 rake gems:install      # repeat until all gems installed
 rake gems              # should show all gems installed [I]

 rake db:migrate        # creates tables in development environment
 rake db:test:clone_structure    # creates tables in test environment
 rake spec              # runs specs -> should be green!

 ./script/server        # go to http://localhost:3000/ in browser

You won't have any data, but should see a few pages render in browser.
